# Movies-ETL
In order to help Amazing Prime get updated information on a daily basis. We created an automated pipeline that takes in new data, performs the appropriate transformations, and loads the data into existing tables.

## Summary of the results: 
1. ETL_function_test: ETL function that read the three Data Files (movies_metadata.csv, ratings.csv, and wikipedia.movies.json)
2. ETL_clean_wiki_movies: We extracted and transformed the Wikipedia Data
3. ETL_clean_kaggle_data:  We extracted and transformed the Kaggle data
4. ETL_create_database: We created the Movie Database
